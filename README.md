# discord-onion
A working node and implementation of a decentralized clone of Discord's API powered by Tor and IPFS

***Anonymity should not be expected in the current version until IPFS gets Tor support or the IPFS dependency is removed!***

## Getting Started

To create a local development copy of the node, clone the client repository into a directory of your choice:
- `git clone https://github.com/Cryption/discord-onion.git`

Make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed. Node versions older than 8.9.2 or NPM versions older than 5.5.1 may not work.

### Installation

1. Navigate to the directory you cloned the repo into.
2. Enter `npm install`

### Running

Enter `npm start` to run a node at localhost:3000
